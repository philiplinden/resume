\section{Detailed Project Descriptions}

\headerwithlabel{Cosmic Dawn Intensity Mapper (CDIM)}{\href{https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019BAAS...51g..23C/abstract}{NASA ADS abstract} | \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03144}{arXiv:1903.03144}}{\bf Graduate Paper}
Contributed to a proposal for a Probe Class (\textasciitilde\$850M) NASA mission
for a 1.5 meter space telescope intended to observe near-infrared light from the
early universe. Compiled financial, mass, and power budgets for the optics,
instruments, cryocooler \& spacecraft. Defined system-level design, generated
representative CAD models and figures of the spacecraft. This mission was 
published in the NASA 2020 Decadal Survey. My contribution: \href{https://github.com/runphilrun/CDIM-design/blob/master/cdim_design.pdf}{\it github.com/runphilrun/CDIM-design}

\headerwithlabel{1 kW Arcjet Thruster}{\href{https://github.com/RIT-Space-Exploration/msd-P17101/blob/master/p17101.pdf}{github.com/RIT-Space-Exploration/msd-P17101}}{\bf Undergraduate Capstone}
Developed the concept, system-level design, and nozzle design for a small scale
arcjet thruster demonstration. Worked in a multidisciplinary team of mechanical
and electrical engineers. Responsible for communication between the team and the
customer (RIT Space Exploration). Designed and performed CFD analysis on the
thruster nozzle.

\headerwithlabel{High Altitude Balloon Autonomous Altitude Control
System}{\href{https://brickworks.github.io/Nucleus/pdr_altitudecontrol/}{brickworks.github.io/Nucleus}}{\it
Work In Progress} Designed a control system for a high altitude balloon (HAB)
to maintain a target altitude by venting gas from the balloon and dropping
ballast mass in flight. I modeled passive flight dynamics of a HAB in MATLAB,
Simulink, and Python. I developed a state machine and control system in
Simulink and used the model to tune a PID controller. I then derived a
state-space model, Kalman filter, and LQR controller from scratch to achieve
better performance. First flight expected to launch in 2021.

\headerwithlabel{SkySat Payload Commissioning \& Recalibration}{Planet}{}
Conducted on-orbit calibration of payload subsystems. I developed new
procedures and Python scripts to automate calibration workflows and commission
the payloads of eight newly launched SkySats and recalibrate payloads of the
rest of the 21-satellite fleet.

\headerwithlabel{Where U At Plants?~(WUAP) High Altitude Balloon Payload}{\href{https://github.com/RIT-Space-Exploration/hab-cv/}{github.com/RIT-Space-Exploration/hab-cv}}{}
Where U At Plants? (WUAP) is a high-altitude balloon payload using on-board
image processing with a Raspberry Pi 3, Python 3 and OpenCV 3.3 to mask RGB
images of the Earth and attempts to mask areas of vegetation using colorspace
transformations. WUAP flew as a payload on RIT Space Exploration's HAB4 high
altitude balloon mission on April 22, 2018. A
\href{https://github.com/RIT-Space-Exploration/hab-cv/blob/master/reports/Project%20Definition%20Document/hab-cv.pdf}{Project
Definition Document} and
\href{https://github.com/RIT-Space-Exploration/hab-cv/blob/master/reports/HAB4%20Post%20Flight%20Report/report_wuap_postflight-hab4.md}{post-flight
report} document the design intent and discuss the results.

\headerwithlabel{Cryogenic Star Tracking Attitude Regulation System (CSTARS)}{RIT Center for Detectors}{}
Designed the mechanical model of CSTARS, an experiment endorsed by the New York
Space Grant and funded with \$100,000 by NASA's Undergraduate Student Instrument
Program. I designed CAD models for the cryogenic thermal regulation system,
telescope, and mechanical supports in Solidworks 2015. I was the systems
engineer for payload integration with a Black Brant IX at NASA Wallops Flight
Facility.

\headerwithlabel{Dragon Capsule Water Sealing}{SpaceX}{}
Designed and tested retrofits to the Dragon Cargo capsule in order to prevent
water ingress on splashdown. Investigated water entry paths, conducted
experiments to validate designs, and implemented modifications on flight
hardware present on Dragon vehicles since the CRS-7 mission.

\headerwithlabel{GEnx Flowpath Spacer Inspection Optimization}{GE Aviation}{}
Optimized parameters for detection of internal wrinkles in composite layups
with complex geometry during ultrasonic inspection. Conducted destructive
microscopy to validate results and presented findings to principal engineers.

\headerwithlabel{SPEX Project Definition Document Template}{\small\href{https://github.com/RIT-Space-Exploration/SPEX-Project-Definition-Documents}{github.com/RIT-Space-Exploration/SPEX-Project-Definition-Documents}}{}
A Project Definition Document (PDD) documents a SPEX project idea and its
objectives. This template defines the internal standard of quality for all SPEX
PDDs and also serves as a template for other projects to build from. This
template was used to define the scope of RIT's payload for the Intercollegiate
Rocket Engineering Competition 2018, earning the project a \$1000 grant from
Students for the Exploration and Development of Space (SEDS).

\headerwithlabel{SPEXcast Podcast}{\href{https://blog.spexcast.com/}{blog.spexcast.com}}{}
I produce, edit, and co-host a space exploration podcast, which is a weekly
discussion podcast the science and technology of space exploation. SPEXcast
also features interviews with space scientists and industry members, including
Tory Bruno, Chris Hadfield, and NASA Scientists.
